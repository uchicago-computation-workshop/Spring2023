**Summary:** Structure-function relationships are a fundamental principle of many naturally occurring systems, including brain networks.  Collective communication among connected neuronal populations is thought to support patterned neural activity, as well as flexible cognitive operations and complex behavior.  Traditional accounts assume uniform structure-function coupling throughout the brain, and often leave out important biological detail. Here I will focus on three new directions to study structure-function coupling: (1) multiplexed models that allow regionally heterogeneous structure-function relationships, (2) brain networks annotated with micro-architectural features, and (3) redefining function as a computational property. Altogether, I hope to show that structural network reconstructions enriched with local molecular and cellular metadata, in concert with more nuanced representations of functions and properties, hold great potential for a truly multiscale understanding of the structure–function relationship.

**Jordan Kemp** Jordan Kemp is an NSF Graduate Research Fellow pursuing a PhD at the University of Chicago Department of Physics. He researches novel theories of social and biological organization by studying agent decision-making in noisy environments. By combining techniques from statistical physics, information theory, and cognitive psychology, he derives theories for agent learning and growth, then studies how these behaviors aggregate at the population level to drive inequality and cooperation. In the past, he has conducted experimental research in both quantum computing and simulation using neutral cold atoms with the Bernien Lab at UChicago, and in gravitational wave detection with Rana Adhikari and the LIGO Group at Caltech. He was raised in rural Pennsylvania and holds a BS in Physics from Tufts University.

**Attendance**: The presentation will be held in Cummings Life Sci Center room 101.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the first issues page of the workshop’s public repository.

**Before the first meeting**, by Wednesday, March 29 @ 11:59pm MACSS students must:

Comment a well-developed question or comment about the reading for this week’s workshop on the public repository.

If you would really like to ask your question in person, please place two exclamation points before your question to signal that you really want to ask it.

Upvote (“thumbs up”) questions and proposals from other people. There may be prizes for top question askers.
