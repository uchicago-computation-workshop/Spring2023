**Summary:** Structure-function relationships are a fundamental principle of many naturally occurring systems, including brain networks.  Collective communication among connected neuronal populations is thought to support patterned neural activity, as well as flexible cognitive operations and complex behavior.  Traditional accounts assume uniform structure-function coupling throughout the brain, and often leave out important biological detail. Here I will focus on three new directions to study structure-function coupling: (1) multiplexed models that allow regionally heterogeneous structure-function relationships, (2) brain networks annotated with micro-architectural features, and (3) redefining function as a computational property. Altogether, I hope to show that structural network reconstructions enriched with local molecular and cellular metadata, in concert with more nuanced representations of functions and properties, hold great potential for a truly multiscale understanding of the structure–function relationship.

**Bratislav Misic** Dr. Bratislav Misic leads the Network Neuroscience Lab. We investigate how cognitive operations and complex behaviour emerge from the connections and interactions among brain areas. The goal of this research is to quantify the effects of disease on brain structure and function. Our research program emphasizes representations and models that not only embody the topological organization of the brain, but also capture the complex multi-scale relationships that link brain network topology to dynamic biological processes, such as neural signalling and disease spread. Our research lies at the intersection of network science, dynamical systems and multivariate statistics, with a focus on complex data sets involving multiple neuroimaging modalities, including fMRI, DWI, MEG/EEG and PET.

**Attendance**: The presentation will be held in Cummings Life Sci Center room 101.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the first issues page of the workshop’s public repository.

**Before the first meeting**, by Wednesday, March 29 @ 11:59pm MACSS students must:

Comment a well-developed question or comment about the reading for this week’s workshop on the public repository.

If you would really like to ask your question in person, please place two exclamation points before your question to signal that you really want to ask it.

Upvote (“thumbs up”) questions and proposals from other people. There may be prizes for top question askers.
