**Summary:** The statistical dynamics of population growth, wealth, and inequality are related through their common description as multiplicative stochastic processes. In these systems, variations in growth rates determine selection, relative wealth, and cooperation. Despite its relevance for biological and social sciences, we still lack a general theory that explains the dynamics of growth rates in terms of agent adaptation to their environment, heterogeneities of traits, and other consequential behaviors. In this talk, we derive a general population dynamics of learning agents leveraging the knowledge of their environments to grow and reinvest their resources. Growth rates emerge in the long-time limit as the mutual information between agents signals and states of the environment. We show that, with knowledge of past and present conditions only, sequential Bayesian inference is optimal for maximizing growth, thus formally associating growth rates with information. We discuss how this framework can address problems of inequality in heterogeneous populations and lay the foundations for a unified general quantitative theory of social and biological phenomena such as the dynamics of cooperation via Hamilton's rule, and the effects of education on life history choices.

**Jordan Kemp** Jordan Kemp is an NSF Graduate Research Fellow pursuing a PhD at the University of Chicago Department of Physics. He researches novel theories of social and biological organization by studying agent decision-making in noisy environments. By combining techniques from statistical physics, information theory, and cognitive psychology, he derives theories for agent learning and growth, then studies how these behaviors aggregate at the population level to drive inequality and cooperation. In the past, he has conducted experimental research in both quantum computing and simulation using neutral cold atoms with the Bernien Lab at UChicago, and in gravitational wave detection with Rana Adhikari and the LIGO Group at Caltech. He was raised in rural Pennsylvania and holds a BS in Physics from Tufts University.
