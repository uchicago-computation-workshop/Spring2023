**Summary:** Material scarcity is associated with crime, as is economic inequality. However, it is not clear why. I will present results from a computational modelling approach with two elements: first, a derivation of rational individual policies in a world of changing resources; and second, simulations of populations of people following these policies. The model suggests that people should turn to crime when two conditions are met: (1) there is a 'desperation threshold', a level of resources below which it is gravely damaging to try to live; and (2) the individual has fallen, or is about to fall, below this level of resources. Simulating populations, the presence in the population of a small fraction of people below desperation level produces a higher crime rate, and lower levels of social trust even among those whose own resources are abundant. I will also present experimental evidence from a 'microsocieties' design, where people play an economic game in groups. The experimental behaviour reproduces a lot of predictions of the model. For example, people are more likely to steal when their resources drop below a desperation threshold; and less likely to trust one another in a world where many other players are desperate.

**Attendance**: 

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the first issues page of the workshop’s public repository.

**Before the first meeting**, by Wednesday, May 3rd @ 11:59pm MACSS students must:

Comment a well-developed question or comment about the reading for this week’s workshop on the public repository.

If you would really like to ask your question in person, please place two exclamation points before your question to signal that you really want to ask it.

Upvote (“thumbs up”) questions and proposals from other people. There may be prizes for top question askers.
