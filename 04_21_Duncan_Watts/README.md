**Summary:** In this talk, Dr. Watts will present a data science perspective to examine fake news, echo chambers, and algorithmic filtering.  He will also discuss whether popular media narratives about tech platforms undermining democracy are justified.

**Bratislav Misic** Dr. Bratislav Misic leads the Network Neuroscience Lab. We investigate how cognitive operations and complex behaviour emerge from the connections and interactions among brain areas. The goal of this research is to quantify the effects of disease on brain structure and function. Our research program emphasizes representations and models that not only embody the topological organization of the brain, but also capture the complex multi-scale relationships that link brain network topology to dynamic biological processes, such as neural signalling and disease spread. Our research lies at the intersection of network science, dynamical systems and multivariate statistics, with a focus on complex data sets involving multiple neuroimaging modalities, including fMRI, DWI, MEG/EEG and PET.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the first issues page of the workshop’s public repository.

**Before the first meeting**, by Wednesday, April 29 @ 11:59pm MACSS students must:

Comment a well-developed question or comment about the reading for this week’s workshop on the public repository.

If you would really like to ask your question in person, please place two exclamation points before your question to signal that you really want to ask it.

Upvote (“thumbs up”) questions and proposals from other people. There may be prizes for top question askers.
